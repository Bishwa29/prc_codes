    "##A1. Probability Density Function refers to the probability distribution for continuous random variables. \n",
    "## Unlike PMF, PDF doesn't directly give the probability at a specific point but gives the probability density at that point.\n",
    "## The area under the curve of the PDF within a range gives the probability that the variable falls within that range.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Probability Mass Function refers to the probability distribution for discrete random variables. \n",
    "## It gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value. In simpler terms, it maps each possible value of the discrete random variable to its probability of occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unlike the PMF, which is for discrete variables, the PDF is for continuous variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Consider rolling a fair six-sided die. The PMF of this random variable would be 1/6 for all outcomes (1,2,3,4,5,6)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Consider the uniform distribution on the interval [0, 1]. The PDF of this random variable ùëã would be:\n",

    "## f(x)=0 for x<0 or ùë•>1\n",

    "\n",
    "## A3. The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is one of the most widely used probability distributions in statistics. It is characterized by its bell-shaped curve and is symmetric around its mean.\n",

    "## Measurement Errors: In many natural and social sciences, measurements are subject to errors. These errors often follow a normal distribution, especially when multiple sources of error are involved.\n",

    "## Biological Traits: Many biological traits such as height, weight, and blood pressure tend to follow a normal distribution in populations.\n",

    "## Financial Data: In finance, returns on investments or stock prices often follow a normal distribution, particularly when considered over longer periods and under certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The parameters of the normal distribution are the mean (ùúá) and the standard deviation (ùúé). These parameters determine the location and spread of the distribution, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mean (ùúá): The mean is the center of the distribution. It determines the location of the peak of the bell curve. Shifting the mean to the right or left moves the entire distribution along the horizontal axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Standard Deviation (ùúé): The standard deviation measures the spread or dispersion of the distribution. A smaller standard deviation results in a narrower, taller curve, while a larger standard deviation leads to a wider, flatter curve. The standard deviation controls how much individual data points vary from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Together, the mean and standard deviation fully characterize the normal distribution. Different combinations of mean and standard deviation can result in different shapes of the normal distribution, but regardless of the specific values, the overall bell-shaped curve remains the same."

    "## Independence: The random variables being sampled must be independent of each other. This means that the outcome of one observation does not affect the outcome of another.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Identically Distributed: The random variables being sampled must be identically distributed. This means that they are drawn from the same population and follow the same probability distribution with the same parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finite Variance: The random variables being sampled must have finite variance (ùúé2). This assumption ensures that the sample mean converges to a normal distribution as the sample size increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Random Sampling: The samples must be drawn randomly from the population of interest. This ensures that the sample is representative of the population and reduces the risk of bias.\n",

    "## Sample Size: While the CLT does not specify a minimum sample size, larger sample sizes tend to produce better approximations to the normal distribution. In practice, a sample size of at least 30 is often recommended, but the exact sample size required depends on the underlying population distribution.\n",
