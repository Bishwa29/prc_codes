Use the training set to train the model, the validation set to tune hyperparameters, and the test set to evaluate the final model's performance. Cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation can help in assessing model performance robustly.\n",

Visual Inspection of Learning Curves: Plotting learning curves that show the model's performance (e.g., training error and validation error) as a function of the training dataset size or training iterations can provide insights into whether the model is overfitting or underfitting. Overfitting is indicated by a large gap between the training and validation error curves, while underfitting is indicated by high error rates on both training and validation sets.\n",
