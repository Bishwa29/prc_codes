    "##Its use in data science mainly in:\n",
    "\n",
    "##Image and Audio Data: Encoding is used to convert images and audio signals into numerical arrays suitable for machine learning models. For images, this involves converting pixel values into a numerical format. For audio, techniques like Fourier transforms or Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are used for feature extraction.\n",
